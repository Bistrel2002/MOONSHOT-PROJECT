  - Begin route display functionality.

- **Achievements:**
  - ❌ Implement path finding for single-floor completed (30/100)
  - ❌ Display basic route initiated (26/100)
  - ✅ Set up Android app structure completed (100/100)

- **Next Steps:**
  - Develop the beacon detection
  - Continue route display development.
  - Enhance UI for destination selection.

## Summary

- **Overall Progress:**
  - Successfully transitioned from documentation to active development phase.
  - Basic Setup and Infrastructure: 78% average completion.
  - Positioning System: 14% average completion (early stages).
  - Core Features: 10% average completion (initiated).

- **Key Achievements:**
  - All foundational setup tasks completed (Unity project, Android structure).
  - AR Foundation integration initiated.
  - Basic positioning functionality established.

- **Upcoming Milestones:**
  - Complete positioning system implementation.
  - Enhance core features functionality.
  - Begin the integration and testing phase.
  - Begin with beacon detection, as I'll receive them in early May.

- **Note:** This month was not too productive; all the planned tasks were not completed, making me redefine the whole project and try to focus on the most important part of the project to deliver. The month of May will be very tight since the main functionality will be implemented, and the most difficult one.
