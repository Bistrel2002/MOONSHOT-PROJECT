# Technical Specification Document: LOC-INDOOR (Indoor Localisation)

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the technical specifications for the LOC-INDOOR indoor navigation system, which leverages Augmented Reality (AR) and Bluetooth beacon technology to provide real-time indoor navigation assistance. It serves as a reference for the development process, outlining architecture, data flow, APIs, security considerations, and deployment strategies.

### 1.1 System Overview
LOC-INDOOR is an indoor navigation application that uses Augmented Reality (AR) and Bluetooth beacon technology to solve the challenge of navigating complex indoor environments. The system provides intuitive, line-based visual guidance through a mobile application, similar to racing game waypoint systems. When users select a destination, the application displays a directional line on the floor through their device's camera view, guiding them to their chosen location.

### 1.2 Development Scope
This technical specification covers:

- Mobile application development (initially for Android, with iOS planned)
- Backend system implementation
- Bluetooth beacon integration
- AR component development
- Location tracking algorithms
- User interface implementation
- Data management and security protocols

## 2. System Architecture Implementation

### 2.1 Client-Server Architecture Overview

The system will implement a client-server architecture with three main components:

1. **Mobile Application (Client):** 
   - Developed with Unity and integrated with AR Foundation
   - Language: C# (Unity scripts)
   - Vector Graphics: Vectrosity plugin for line rendering
   - Bluetooth: Native Android Bluetooth APIs with platform-specific plugins
2. **Backend Services (Server):** 
   - RESTful API for authentication, venue data, and general requests, services built on a cloud platform
   - WebSockets for real-time navigation updates.
   - Framework: Node.js with Express
   - Database: MongoDB (venue data) and PostgreSQL (user data)
   - Authentication: JWT-based token system
   - Hosting: AWS infrastructure
3. **Infrastructure Components:** 
   - Physical Bluetooth beacons deployed within venues
   - Data Storage: AWS S3 for venue maps and assets
   - CDN: AWS CloudFront for static content delivery
   - CI/CD: GitHub Actions with automated testing

### 2.2 Architectural Implementation Flow

The implementation will follow a layered approach:

1. **Data Layer** - Database design, ORM mapping, and data access patterns
2. **Service Layer** - Business logic, positioning algorithms, and route calculations
3. **API Layer** - RESTful endpoints for client-server communication
4. **Presentation Layer** - Mobile application UI/UX and AR components
