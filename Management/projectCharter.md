# LOC-INDOOR Project Charter

## Project Overview
LOC-INDOOR is an innovative indoor navigation system that combines Augmented Reality (AR) and Bluetooth beacon technology to provide intuitive, line-based visual guidance for navigating complex indoor environments. The system aims to solve the challenges of indoor navigation in spaces where traditional GPS is ineffective, such as airports, shopping malls, hospitals, and large public buildings.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile application that provides real-time, AR-based navigation guidance using Bluetooth beacons for precise indoor positioning. The system will display a continuous directional line on the floor through the user's device camera view, similar to racing game waypoint systems, making navigation intuitive and user-friendly.

## Business Case
- **Market Need**: Traditional indoor navigation solutions often rely on 2D maps or simple arrows, which can be confusing in complex environments
- **Competitive Advantage**: AR-based line navigation provides a more intuitive and user-friendly experience
- **Target Market**: Airports, shopping malls, and hospitals.
- **ROI Potential**: Reduced customer service costs for venues, improved visitor experience

## Project Objectives
1. Develop a mobile application for Android (with future iOS support) that provides AR-based indoor navigation
2. Implement precise indoor positioning using Bluetooth beacon technology
3. Create an intuitive user interface with line-based AR navigation
4. Ensure accessibility features for users with special needs
5. Achieve positioning accuracy of at least 0.7 meters in areas with proper beacon coverage
6. Support multi-floor navigation with clear floor transition indicators
7. Implement offline functionality for basic navigation features

## Project Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-2)**: Requirements gathering and system design
- **Phase 2 (Months 3-4)**: Core development and testing
- **Phase 3 (Months 5-6)**: Pilot deployment and refinement
- **Phase 4 (Month 7)**: Full release and documentation


## Success Criteria
1. Positioning accuracy of at least 0.7 meters in areas with proper beacon coverage
2. Application launch time under 10 seconds
3. Route calculation completed within 3 seconds
4. AR overlay rendering within 100ms
5. Battery consumption not exceeding 15% per hour of active navigation on Android phones having a minimum version of 11
7. Positive user feedback from pilot testing

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: AR performance issues on lower-end devices
  - **Mitigation**: Implement fallback navigation options and optimize AR rendering


### Project Risks
- **Risk**: Timeline delays
  - **Mitigation**: Regular progress tracking and agile development methodology
