# SECOND PROJECT RESEARCH

    Still with the same idea of trying to help old age people, I decided to direct my self toward Camera system and smart personal assistant that uses AI.

## FUNCTION

 1. Camera Monitoring System: Yes, a home monitoring system using cameras could be used to detect falls, unusual movements or signs of distress in the elderly. These cameras could be equipped with image recognition and artificial intelligence software to automatically detect situations that require intervention. Captured images or videos could also be stored and be accessible remotely for caregivers or family members who wish to check on the well-being of the elderly person.

2. Smart Personal Assistant: Design an intelligent personal assistant that uses artificial intelligence to help seniors in their daily lives. The assistant could help seniors remember to take their medication, and provide them with useful information about weather, news, and local events. And also have access to their personal caregiver's contacts and family's members contacts, make use of a cloud storage that stores relevant information. 

## LINK BETWEEN THE TWO FUNTIONS

    For this project i decided to take two project and make one with several functionalities, then the question is what is the link between the home monitoring system and the smart personal assistant ? As i just later un mentioned above, the function of the camera monitoring system, a link between the first and second function be done as follow: each time the Camera detect a situation that requires an intervention, send the information to the smart personal assistant, and this authomatically contact loveones like family members, or caregivers for them to intervain immediately. And lastly the the captured image and videos, will be stored in the cloud of the smart personal assistant, and will be easily accessed remotely by the family members or caregivers anytime they wishes to check at the elderly-person health or well-being.

### WHY DID I DECIDED TO CHOOSE THIS
    Now our days many, elderly person lives alone and they have nobody to assist them in their daily routine, some of them have lost of memories, and they need some particular cargiver or family member who will constantly come and visit them just to check their well-being. And this is sometime painfull for people who live several km away from their old age person, so with this project I'm trying to help those people to be constantly updated about the well-being of their relatives without been physicaly present, and also get access to quick emergency each time there is a critical situation just by authomatically contact the caregiver or the family member who in turns contact immediately the emmergency.
    My second reason is because many people now our days have a bad view on AI, they thing AI can only be used to harm others, with this project, I want to prove to them that AI have many positive advantage, is and will be very helpful in our community, and can save lifes.
